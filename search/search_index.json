Motivation MkDocs is a powerful flexible tool designed to generate static sites focused on project documentation . The default theme is at best dated and at worst never really that great (sorry). This does not put your documentation in the best light. Fortunately MkDocs is a great piece of software and highly customisable so creating an alternative theme is possible (many have). What is this? This is a modern theme for MkDocs that helps developers generate documentation they can be proud of. The theme takes it's inspiration from the current de-facto standard employed by the likes of Stripe and Twilio. In addition the theme takes style-notes from Docusaurus which has set the bar recently. Why use this? This is for those who: Already love MKDocs and don't want to change but would like a more modern style. Believe documentation should be served as static pages without the overhead implied by dynamic frameworks. Can I buy it? Yes. This theme is being used as a test case for using Stripe Customer Portal.

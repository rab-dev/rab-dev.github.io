# MkDocs Elegant Theme

**MkDocs Elegant Theme** is a theme for `MkDocs` to help create elegant documentation.

## Motivation

`MkDocs` is a powerful flexible tool designed to generate **static sites** focused
on **project documentation**.

!!! info ""
    The default theme is at best dated and at worst never really that great (sorry). 
    This does not put your documentation in the best light.

Fortunately `MkDocs` is a great piece of software and highly customisable so creating 
an alternative theme is possible (many have).

## What is this?

This is a modern theme for `MkDocs` that helps developers generate documentation
they can be proud of.

> The theme takes it's inspiration from the current de-facto standard employed by
the likes of Stripe and Twilio.

In addition the theme takes _style-notes_ from Docusaurus which has set the bar
recently.

## Why use this?

This is for those who:
 
* Already love `MKDocs` and don't want to change but would like a more modern style.
* Believe documentation should be served as static pages without the overhead implied by dynamic frameworks.

## Can I buy it?

Yes. This theme is being used as a test case for using Stripe Customer Portal.
When that is up and running a button will be posted here.

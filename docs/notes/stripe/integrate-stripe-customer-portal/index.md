# Integrate Stripe Customer Portal

!!! info ""
    The Stripe Customer Portal enables users to **self-serve subscriptions**
     for an application **so we don't have to**.

## Why should we care?

The portal handles:

* **Subscriptions**
* **Billing**
* **Invoices**
* **Payments**

_Which is a lot._

## How does it work?

The basic flow is:

!!! green ""
    1. We tell the portal about our products.
    2. We send users to the portal.
    3. The portal tells us when users buy our products.

We can do the first of these manually. For the other two we need a server.

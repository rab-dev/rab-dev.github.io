# Step 1 - Configure the Portal

First we need to **configure the portal** so it knows about our **products** and 
our **prices**.

## How to configure the portal

There is nothing inherently difficult here. 

> This is just standard Stripe fare and unless we have an automated means will involve
picking through their interface to name our products, upload images and set
prices. 

Straightfoward but tedious.

## Branding

We can optionally brand the portal with our:

* Business Name
* Icon
* Logo
* Brand Color
* Accent Color
